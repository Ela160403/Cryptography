To document the tabular implementation of the Hill cipher in your `README.md` file on GitHub, you can include the following sections:

### 1. **Introduction**
A brief introduction to the Hill cipher, including its significance in cryptography.

### 2. **Hill Cipher Overview**
An explanation of how the Hill cipher works, focusing on its use of linear algebra and matrix multiplication to encrypt and decrypt text.

### 3. **Mathematical Background**
   - **Matrix Multiplication**: Explain how the encryption process uses matrix multiplication.
   - **Modular Arithmetic**: Describe how the Hill cipher employs modular arithmetic to ensure that the resulting ciphertext consists of valid characters.

### 4. **Key Matrix and Plaintext Vector**
   - **Key Matrix**: Discuss the role of the key matrix, ensuring it's invertible in modulo 26.
   - **Plaintext Vector**: Explain how the plaintext is divided into vectors of equal length as the key matrix's dimensions.

### 5. **Encryption Process**
   - **Step 1**: Multiply the key matrix with the plaintext vector.
   - **Step 2**: Perform modulo 26 operations on the resulting vector.
   - **Step 3**: Convert the numerical values back to letters to form the ciphertext.

### 6. **Decryption Process**
   - **Step 1**: Compute the inverse of the key matrix.
   - **Step 2**: Multiply the inverse matrix by the ciphertext vector.
   - **Step 3**: Perform modulo 26 operations on the resulting vector.
   - **Step 4**: Convert the numerical values back to letters to retrieve the plaintext.

### 7. **Example**
   - **Key Matrix**: \( K = \begin{pmatrix} 3 & 3 \\ 2 & 5 \end{pmatrix} \)
   - **Plaintext**: "HELLO" (assuming 2x2 matrix, divide into "HE" and "LL")
   - **Encryption**: Show step-by-step how "HE" becomes "FN".
   - **Decryption**: Show how "FN" is decrypted back to "HE".

### 8. **Tabular Representation**
   - **Plaintext to Numerical Conversion**:
     ```
     H = 7, E = 4
     ```
   - **Matrix Multiplication**:
     ```
     K * Plaintext Vector = Ciphertext Vector
     ```
     | Matrix       | H | E |
     |--------------|---|---|
     | **3**        | 7 | 4 |
     | **3**        | 7 | 4 |
     | **2**        | 7 | 4 |
     | **5**        | 7 | 4 |

   - **Ciphertext Vector to Alphabet**:
     ```
     5 -> F
     13 -> N
     ```
   - **Resulting Ciphertext**: "FN"

### 9. **Implementation Code**
   - Provide a code snippet for implementing the Hill cipher in Python, Java, or another language.

### 10. **Conclusion**
A summary of the Hill cipher's strengths and potential vulnerabilities.

This structure should help create a comprehensive and informative `README.md` file for your Hill cipher tabular implementation.
